# NewYorkTimes-Gaza-War-Coverage
This respository contains the main non-proprietary data behind my paper "An Analysis of the New York Times Coverage of the War Between Israel and Hamas".
The file "NewYorkTimes-Tagged Articles for Sharing" contains the complete list of articles analyzed for this study.  For each row there is the Proquest document ID, the authors, URL at the NYTimes.com website, the publication date, and two main topic tags, in that sequence.
The topic tags are followed by a "Ring number" (0-4) that is based upon the combination of topics (see Ring Categories file). 

The Ring number is followed by 17 content tags which are all binary (0/1).  The names of these tags are listed here and are described in the paper as well.
Palestinian Causualty,	Lebanese Casualty,	Israeli Casualty on Oct 7,	Israeli Casualty post Oct 7,	Palestinian Suffering,	Lebanese Suffering,	Israeli Suffering non-October 7,	Oct 7 Victim Suffering,	Hamas attack Oct 7,	Palestinian Violence Post Oct7,	Other Violence against Israel,	Israeli Violence,	Hostages,	Palestinian or Lebanese Personal Suffering,	Israeli Personal Suffering (non-Oct 7),	Oct 7 Victim Personal Story,	Hamas Fighters casualty

For a few of the articles a url could not be found but they exist in the Proquest database, in probably archived print editions of the times.  Note that the article "publication date" does not always match the url date because the publication date refers to the print edition

The fulltext of each article was used in the study.  These can obviously not be shared here because of the NY Times copyright.  If you happen to find what appears to be a tagging error please email me at edieal.pinker@yale.edu.

The file "Ring Categories" maps pairs of main topic tags to a number 0 to 5 that reflects a degree of closeness to the activities on the ground. This is described in the paper.  
The final column gives the count of articles tagged with that particular pairing of main topcs.  Note 1: Ring 5 are excluded from the analysis and so do not appear in the file of articles. 
Note 2: There are many combinations that have only one or two articles.  It may appear a little silly to identify a topic combo that appears once and some of them may appear to be very similar to other combinations.
This was done to leave open the option to create different groupings of articles in later analyses without having to re-read and retag each article.  For this study the main focus is on the Rings and 17 other binary tags.
